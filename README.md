I'm a devotee of truth.

I believe that the traditional way of architecturing a knowledge base has many flaws, so I'm building a brand new infastructure called 'Primordial Heavenly Scripture' based on how Yuanshi Tianzun - an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent god - perceive the universe.

My knowledge base cover all 12 aspects of my life:

- Financial Life
- Character
- Social Life
- Health & Fitness
- Life Vision
- Career
- Quality of Life
- Love & Relationship
- Intellectual Life
- Spirituality
- Emotional Life
- Parenting

Since I'm just a mortal, this knowledge base would never come anywhere near what Yuanshi Tianzun has achieved, but it serves as a proof-of-concept that this is possible.

Within this knowledge base, I implement several tools and concepts to making my inquiry learning process more smoothly:

- Obsidian desktop app - primary markdown notetaking tool
- Notion web app - strutural cloud storage for multi-media resources
- GitHub - host my sync notes through Obsidian Git plugin
- Excalidraw plugin
- Excalibrain plugin
- Git plugin
- Dataview plugin
- Reminders - macOS built-in notetaking app

The concept utilized to make this knowledge base possible come from serveral sources:

- Justin Sung's Studying and time management course at iCanStudy
- Jon & Missy Butcher's Lifebook - Design Your Ideal Life course at Mindvalley
- Excalidraw & Excalibrain Obsidian plugin utilization by Zsolt's Visual Personal Knowledge Management on Youtube
- Obsidian sync through Obsidian Git plugin

Only the ones who can detect my password database and crack through the cryptographic behind it can access to my version of 'Primordial Heavenly Scripture.'

Or you can just build your own version of it.

Each and every individuals who cultivate 'Primordial Heavenly Scripture' will create a different version of it, that's because we're just mortal with limited resources and time, so in other word we're only getting a fraction of it. The only person who got access to the full version of 'Primordial Heavenly Scripture' is Yuanshi Tianzun himself, who is an omniscient god.
